##Digital Humanities Laboratory, EPFL.
Founded in 2012 by Prof. Frédéric Kaplan, the Digital Humanities Laboratory (DHLAB) from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne develops computational approaches applied to humanities. Research at the DHLAB is highly interdisciplinary and explores a variety of domains including linguistics, literature, history, art history, and architecture, with the support of methods from the fields of computer science, computer vision, NLP, geographic information processing, photogrammetry, and web development. The DHLAB develops methods and software for the transcription and annotation of ancient documents, the extraction of information from historical texts, and the reconstruction and visualization of geographical spaces in 2 and 3D.
 
##Institute of Computational Linguistics, UZH.
The Institute has been the leading language technology department in the German speaking part of Switzerland for the last 20 years. In addition to engineering-oriented research in machine translation, biomedical/political text mining, and sentiment analysis, the institute successfully completed projects to build and annotate large corpora for various languages.
 
##Luxembourg Center for Contemporary and Digital History, Luxembourg University.
Founded in 2016, the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History is dedicated to the study of digital history, contemporary Luxembourgish history, and Modern European history. It promotes an interdisciplinary approach to the field of contemporary history with a particular focus on new digital methods and tools for historical research and teaching. The centre strives to act as an international hub for reflection on the methodological and epistemological challenges of doing history in the digital age. The centre particularly focuses on the use and development of digital methods and tools for innovative historical research, and serves as a catalyst for creative scholarship and hands-on approaches to new forms of public dissemination and societal engagement with history in Luxembourg. Members of the centre have diverse backgrounds in the historical disciplines, social sciences, information science, design, and application development. Staff at the centre has rich experience in user-centred design, co-design, and the development of interfaces and visualizations together with humanities scholars and social scientists.
