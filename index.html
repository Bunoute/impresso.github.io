    <div class="headline"><span>How can newspapers help understanding the past?<br/> How to explore them?</span></div>

    <p> For long held on library and archive shelving, <em>newspapers are currently undergoing mass digitization</em>, and millions of facsimiles, along with their <a href='/linguistics'>machine-readable</a> content acquired via Optical Character Recognition, are becoming accessible via a variety of online portals. If this represents a major step forward in terms of preservation of and access to documents, much remains to be done in order to provide an extensive and sophisticated access to the content of these digital resources. In this regard, we are still facing many challenges.</p>

      In this context, the proposed interdisciplinary project “Media Monitoring of the Past” aims at the development of a methodologically reflected technological framework to enable new ways of engaging with multilingual digital content of historical newspapers and new approaches to address historical questions. More precisely, the project will apply text mining techniques to transform noisy and unstructured textual content into semantically indexed, structured, and linked data; develop innovative visualization interfaces to enable the seamless exploration of complex and vast amounts of historical data; identify needs on the side of historians which may also translate into new text mining applications and new ways to study history; and synergistically reflect on the usage of digital tools in historical sciences from a practical, methodological, and epistemological point of view.
